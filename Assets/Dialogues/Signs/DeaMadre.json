{"inkVersion":20,"root":[["^Mother Goddess found in a Tomb - Cuccuru S’Arriu (Cabras-Sardinia-Italy).","\n","^Almost all the megalithic monuments were dedicated to the Sardinian goddess of beauty and love, Cunnusa, called Aphrodite by the Greeks.  Imperial Rome subsequently identified the female divinity Cunnusa as the Winged Goddess, also called the Goddess of Victory, with open wings.","\n","^The Mother Goddess’ worship is confirmed by the many statuettes revealing how a feminine deity was honoured in Sardinia. They had elaborated hairstyles, important breasts and wide hips, fertility indexes. It was a deity that was reproducing by parthenogenesis, \"born by itself\", without masculine intervention. Her power was everywhere, in the stones and in the water, in the animals and in the flowers.","\n","^Subsequently, the figures of the Mother Goddess’ in the Copper Age will be found on metal sheets, but the divine male figure is already beginning to join that of the Mother Goddess (between 5,000 and 4,000 BC).","\n","^Over time the Mother Goddess will be replaced by male figures becoming the daughter of a father god, wife of a husband god, sister of a brother god, mother of a god and male child. Then, with the cultural superimposition of Christianity on Paganism, all the megalithic sites dedicated to the Goddess Cunnusa were gradually rebaptized, literally, by the priests of the new Church.","\n",["done",{"#f":5,"#n":"g-0"}],null],"done",{"#f":1}],"listDefs":{}}
