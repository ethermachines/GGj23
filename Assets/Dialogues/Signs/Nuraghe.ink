The main type of ancient megalithic edifice found in Sardinia, developed during the Nuragic Age between 1900 and 730 BC. 
Today it is the symbol of Sardinia and its distinctive culture, the Nuragic civilization.
There is no consensus on the function of the nuraghes: they could have been religious temples, ordinary dwellings, rulers' residences, military strongholds, meeting halls, or a combination of the former.
Some of the nuraghes are, however, located in strategic places such as hills from which important passages could be easily controlled.
Nuraghes are inscribed on the UNESCO World Heritage Site list.
