Antero! It's nice to see you!
How's mom and dad?
It's a nice place isn't it? A good break from the city right?
I moved from the city many years ago, living here makes me feel closer to my Sardinian roots.
Me and the organization set up our latest findings just beyond the nuraghe, we found some cool stuff dating up to 4000 years ago!
Check the signs for info, I'm sure you'll discover a lot about your ancestors' culture.
I also set up a little puzzle game for the kids! I don't know if it's overkill really...
...and don't ask me how I set that up eheh.
I'm still working on it, but give it a try! I placed a prize just for you!
